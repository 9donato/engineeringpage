<h1 style=color:red;">Football Project</h1>
<p style=color:green;"> This project is about looking at other football data from other highschools and breking down the plays they run. By doing this it helps the Mayfield football team and the coaches on the sidelines.
This project made me learn how to use pivots tables and excell in general. Before this project I didn't really know anything about breaking down a spreadsheet and looking at number. However, now I feel I can help people out if they have any questions.</p>
