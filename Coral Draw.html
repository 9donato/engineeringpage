<p style=color:green;">This project help students reate stickers and designs for there chromebooks. For my chromebook, I made the Cleveland Indians C in red for my sticker. It fits perfectly o my chromebook and I really like it. Although I printed out a sticker, I struggled with this project but still got the work done.</p>
