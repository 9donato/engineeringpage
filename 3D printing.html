<h1 style="color:red;">3D Printing</h1>
<p style="color:green;">For this project we had to to screate our own 3D printed model. I chose to print a key chain which said OHIO on it and had the Ohio Sate O under it. I enjoyed designong the key chain and seeing how much I can do with inventor. Although my key chain has'nt printed I think I made the right dimensions to fit my keys. This was one of my better skills in this class, due to the fact that I worked with invetor freshman year. </p>
